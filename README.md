 Diabetes Prediction with Logistic Regression
This ReadMe summarizes the key steps involved in a diabetes prediction project using R and logistic regression:
1.	Data Loading and Exploration: The project begins by loading the dataset, exploring its structure, and gaining an initial understanding of its content.
2.	Data Cleaning: The data is cleaned to ensure consistency and usability. This includes encoding the "Outcome" variable as a factor and improving column names.
3.	Data Transformation: The dataset is transformed into a long format, which is often more suitable for modeling and visualization.
4.	Data Visualization: Box plots are created to visualize the distribution of predictor features in relation to the diabetes outcome. This step helps identify potential patterns.
5.	Model Building: A logistic regression model is constructed using the tidymodels package. The model is trained to predict the "Outcome" variable based on the other available features.
6.	Model Evaluation: Model predictions are made on a test dataset, and accuracy is calculated to measure how well the model performs in predicting diabetes outcomes.
This summary provides an overview of the project's workflow, from data loading and cleaning to model building and evaluation.
